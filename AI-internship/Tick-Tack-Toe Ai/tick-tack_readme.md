## Gameplay

- The board is displayed as a 3x3 grid, and each cell is numbered from 1 to 9.
- When it's your turn, enter a number between 1 and 9 to place your 'X' on the board.
- The AI will then make its move.
- The game continues until one player wins or it's a tie.
- After the game ends, you'll have the option to replay.
