# CODSOFT
This is the repository for the submission of all the tasks I've done under the internship I did with Codsoft.
Here you may find seperate folders for seperate internships I did.

The AI-internship folder contains:
1) A .py file of the code
2) A video in mp4 format showcasing the result
3) Also a readme file describing the project
